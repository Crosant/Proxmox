## README TO BE UPDATED

Ports of tteck's proxmox scripts to ARM64.

Any issues with the scripts, please put an issue within this repository rather than upstream, as it is likely caused by my modifications.

You can get a script from this by using the original website, and modifying the url in the bash statement to call from my user rather than tteck, until I can figure out how to get a website for these scripts up.

Any applications not in ported or unsupported need to be tested for whether they could be ported or not.

## Compatibility Guide
